# WashU_CourseGrabber_Extension

Helps users add their courses at their respective registration time. 

Clicking the start button will initiate the program to add courses. It is recommended to do this approximately 2 mintues in advance to prevent unexpected issues. Please note that this extension REQUIRES LOGIN to the WashU WebSTAC system; failure to log in will result in unsuccessful grabbing. This program is intended to ease the process for students to get into the courses they want. 

## INSTRUCTIONS

1) Install the WashU CourseGrabber Extension.
2) Be ready to REGISTER and have all your courses in your Registration worksheet!
4) Before registration (a minimum of 2 minutes in advance is advised), click the start button. If you're already on WebSTAC, the registration process will start immediately. If you're on other webpages, it will take you to WebSTAC log-in first.
5) After all the courses are added successfully, click the STOP button to end the program.
